# ConfigureAwait Solution

A collection of .NET 9 projects demonstrating best practices and performance considerations for asynchronous programming in C#, with a focus on the use of `ConfigureAwait(false)`.

## Projects

- **AsyncHttpUtils**: Utility library for robust async HTTP calls.
- **WebAPI-Performance-Analyzer**: ASP.NET Core Web API to benchmark `await` vs `ConfigureAwait(false)`.
- **WpfConfigureAwaitDemo**: WPF app showing UI thread implications of `ConfigureAwait`.
- **BackgroundJobProcessor**: Background service comparing async job execution with and without context capture.

## Why `ConfigureAwait(false)`?

Using `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library and backend code can:

- Prevent deadlocks in UI and ASP.NET applications
- Reduce unnecessary context switching
- Improve performance and scalability

Each project demonstrates these principles in a different context.
